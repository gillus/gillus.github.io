## About Me

I'm the CTO of **Clearbox AI Solutions** where I lead the synthetic data solutions technology and deployment.

I'm passionate about applying the latest Artificial Intelligence technologies to facilitate innovation in companies -- small or big. Together with my team, I'm building a tool for continuously assessing and improving ML models using synthetic data.

I have a PhD in computational mathematics from the **Delft University of Technology**. I worked as a research consultant and software development lead for a consultancy firm for over 5 years in the Netherlands serving clients in the safe critical industries in the United States, South Africa and Germany.

My expertise is within designing mathematical and statistical validation techniques essential to trust the predictions of AI models. I published high impact research papers on uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in simulation models and have spoken at international conferences in the US, Japan, and Brazil. I like to experiment with hydroponic farming in my free time.
